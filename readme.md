# Ask Pride & Prejudice

a [Gumroad product engineering challenge][challenge-docs] project
which ports [askmybook][askmybook] to Ruby and swaps out the book.

# notes

* **why "Pride & Prejudice?** I would've liked to pick a book with
  less narrative and more point of view, but I couldn't think of a
  freely available book that would qualify. I opted for Pride &
  Prejudice somewhat arbitrarily, but figured its length approximated
  "the Minimalist Entrepreneur" better than something shorter or
  something longer.

# to-do

* (in progress) generate embeddings with openai
* render a simple react component; shakapacker specific instructions here https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails
