# Ask "the Real Frank Zappa Book"

a [Gumroad product engineering challenge][challenge-docs] project
which ports [askmybook][askmybook] to Ruby and swaps out the book.

# notes

* **why _not_ "Pride & Prejudice"?** after I'd gotten the app running
  locally, the answers it returned seemed to be of uncannily high
  quality. I wondered whether OpenAI might have been trained on "Pride
  & Prejudice". While the jury's out, there's good reason to think
  that this might be the case; in any case, [I'm not the first to ask
  this question][yahoo-news]. I opted to choose another book so that
  might project might have less to do with how OpenAI was trained.

* **why "Pride & Prejudice?** I would've liked to pick a book with
  less narrative and more point of view, but I couldn't think of a
  freely available book that would qualify. I opted for "Pride &
  Prejudice" somewhat arbitrarily, but figured its length approximated
  "the Minimalist Entrepreneur" better than something shorter or
  something longer. "Pride & Prejudice" also has the benefit of being
  a stock English class book, so questions and answers about the book
  are easily found.
